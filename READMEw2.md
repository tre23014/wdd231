## Features

- Displays park name, description, and banner image dynamically.
- Uses a reusable template system to generate media cards for different park information areas.
- Dynamically inserts contact info (mailing address and voice phone number) in the footer.
- Uses modular JavaScript (`parkService.mjs`) and optionally external JSON (`parkInfo.json`) for flexible content management.
